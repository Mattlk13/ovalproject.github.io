title: OVAL Language Versioning Policy Change 
layout: flat
---

<p>Starting with Version 5.11, the OVAL Language will have a new versioning 
policy that will allow the OVAL Community to refine OVAL and quickly get those 
changes into a new release for use within content and tools.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Over the years, the OVAL Language Versioning Policy required that the entire 
OVAL Language be versioned as a whole (e.g. 5.0, 5.7, 5.10, etc.) meaning that 
releases would typically represent a significant amount of work and time before 
a new release would be published.  Unfortunately, these long release timelines 
often meant that the capabilities needed by the OVAL Community would not become 
available until the release was published.</p>

<p>To address this and enable the OVAL 
Community to more rapidly adopt new capabilities, MITRE in conjunction with the 
OVAL Board developed a separate versioning policy by which the core models of 
the OVAL Language (OVAL Common, OVAL Definitions, OVAL System Characteristics, 
OVAL Results, OVAL Directives, and OVAL Variables) and individual platform 
extension models (Android, Cisco, Linux, UNIX, Windows, etc.) would be 
versioned independently allowing for the core models to remain relatively stable 
while the more dynamic platform extensions are free to evolve as needed.</p>

<p>It is expected that for higher level usages of OVAL (for example SCAP) a rolled up
version of the various Core and Platform Extensions would be created to create a 
snapshot of OVAL for purposes of things like validation.</p>

<p>This new versioning policy is described below and went into effect on November 30, 2014 
with the official release of Version 5.11 of the OVAL Language and with the 
approval of the OVAL Board.</p>
