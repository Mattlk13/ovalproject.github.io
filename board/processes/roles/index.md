Furthermore, if an OVAL Board member cannot make a meeting, they can designate a proxy to sit in for them if they wish.</p>

			<p>Emeritus members may participate at their discretion in technical, liaison, or advisory tasks. This role recognizes the significant past contributions of a member to OVAL and allows them to provide valuable feedback in an ad-hoc manner although they may no longer serve in a position that warrants a direct role on the board. Since emeritus members are not required to participate in OVAL Board activities, they are not permitted to participate in tasks that exercise the decisional authority granted to the OVAL Board. However, they are encouraged to share their thoughts and opinions on matters that are being decided.</p>
