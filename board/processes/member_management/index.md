	<p>In adding new members to the OVAL Board, it is important to remember that a single organization is limited to at most two (2) seats on the OVAL Board and that the proportional balance among the board's membership (tool vendors, operating system vendors, etc.) should be maintained.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>A prospective OVAL Board member ("prospect") is identified, typically through one of the following scenarios:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A current OVAL Board member recommends the prospect.</li>
				<li>The prospect, or the prospect's parent organization, asks to be an OVAL Board member.</li>
				<li>The OVAL Moderator identifies a prospect.</li>
			</ul>

	<div class="panel panel-primary">
		<div class="panel-heading">
			<h4 class="panel-title">Evaluation</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>The prospect is evaluated by the OVAL Moderator through one or more discussions. At least one discussion, an "interview," is held face-to-face or by phone.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The prospect is presented with the detailed list of OVAL Board member roles and tasks as defined in the <a href="/board/processes/roles">OVAL Board Member Roles, Tasks, and Qualifications</a>.</li>
				<li>The OVAL Moderator and the prospect identify and discuss the prospect's role and expected tasks.</li>
				<li>The prospect demonstrates participation within the community on the public OVAL mailing lists.</li>
				<li>If the prospect belongs to an organization that produces a product or service, it is strongly recommended that the organization participate in the OVAL Adoption Program.</li>
				<li>The prospect provides the OVAL Moderator with biographical information (such as a resume) that demonstrates an ability to perform the tasks.</li>
				<li>The prospect, and the prospect's parent organization, approves the level of effort required for the prospect's participation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Based on these discussions, the OVAL Moderator determines if the prospect is qualified to be an OVAL Board member, and the process moves to the OVAL Board Feedback step.</p>
		</div>

	<a name="feedback"></a>
	<div class="panel panel-primary">
		<div class="panel-heading">
			<h4 class="panel-title">Feedback</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>The OVAL Moderator solicits feedback from the OVAL Board in order to determine if the prospect should be granted membership on the OVAL Board.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The OVAL Moderator announces a qualified prospect to the OVAL Board through the OVAL Board mailing list. A summary of the discussion(s) with the prospect, from the Evaluation step, will be shared with the OVAL Board to help in the decision making process.</li>
				<li>OVAL Board members are provided with at least two (2) weeks to provide feedback to the OVAL Board regarding the prospect, and request additional information if desired. This can be done by sending a message to <a href="mailto:oval-board-list@lists.mitre.org">oval-board-list@lists.mitre.org</a> or scheduling a conference call.</li>
				<li>After the review period, the OVAL Moderator will send out a request to the OVAL Board to vote on whether the prospect should be approved for membership.</li>

		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>If the prospect is approved by the OVAL Board after the Feedback step, then the OVAL Moderator adds the prospect as a full member to the Board.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The new member is announced to the OVAL Board mailing list. The announcement includes the member's biographical information, role, and expected tasks.</li>
				<li>The new member is announced on the OVAL Web site and in an OVAL Announce Newsletter.</li>
				<li>The new member begins participating actively, in accordance with their expected tasks, within two (2) months of their addition to the Board.</li>
